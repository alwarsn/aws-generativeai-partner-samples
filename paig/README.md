# [PAIG](https://paig.ai)

**PAIG** (Pronounced similar to *paige* or *payj*) is an open-source project designed to protect Generative AI (GenAI)
applications by ensuring security, safety, and observability. As the technologies and approaches for writing GenAI
applications evolve rapidly, PAIG offers a versatile framework that addresses the latest security and safety challenges
and enables the integration of point security and safety solutions without requiring applications to be rewritten. For
more information, please visit the <a href="https://paig.ai/" target="_blank">PAIG website</a>

## Sample Use Cases

This subdirectory contains sample use cases for integrating PAIG with various AWS GenAI components and services to
