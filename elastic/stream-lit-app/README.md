# Hybrid Geo Spatial RAG with Elastic Search and Amazon Bedrock

## About
In this streamlit application you will see how to use Elastic search, Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic Claude 3 and Langchain to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution that leverages Geospatial features of Elastic.

This application introduces an interactive AI agent designed to assist with real estate inquiries. Users looking to purchase properties, such as townhomes, condos, or single-family homes in specific locations (e.g., New York, NY or Cupertino, CA) can use the agent to find listings that match their preferences. These preferences can include factors like city, distance, property type, and desired amenities such as a swimming pool or lawn.
