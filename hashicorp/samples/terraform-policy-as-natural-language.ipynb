    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will show you how to use Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic Claude for policy management and governance that helps organizations maintain control and compliance across their infrastructure and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It will allow users to define policies in natural language without dependency on any domain-specific language (DSL). It integrates with terraform allowing organizations to define, implement, and enforce policies for infrastructure of their cloud and on-premises environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the natural language policy definition capabilities of Anthropic Claude via Amazon Bedrock, let's take the use case of creating IT security policies for a growing tech company.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persona\n",
    "You are Sarah, the newly appointed Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at TechGrowth Inc., a rapidly expanding software company. As the company scales, you need to establish comprehensive IT security policies that align with industry standards and regulations. However, you're facing challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your team lacks expertise in policy writing.\n",
    "2. You need policies that are clear and understandable to all employees, not just IT specialists.\n",
    "3. The policies must be adaptable as the company grows and technology evolves.\n",
    "4. You're under time pressure to implement these policies before the next board meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "To fulfill this use case, in this notebook we will show how to define policies in plain natural language and using Foundation Model (FM) to validate if the terraform plan complies with the defined security guidelines.We will use the Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet Foundation model using the Amazon Bedrock API and Langchain.

      "Let's analyze the policy and the Terraform script step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Policy requirement:\n",
      "   The policy states that \"all EC2 instances should have tags\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Terraform script analysis:\n",
      "   a. The script defines an AWS provider and an EC2 instance resource.\n",
      "   b. The EC2 instance is created using the resource \"aws_instance\" named \"example_server\".\n",
      "   c. In the resource block, we can see a \"tags\" section:\n",
      "      ```\n",
      "      tags = {\n",
      "        Name = \"JacksBlogExample\"\n",
      "      }\n",
      "      ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Policy compliance:\n",
      "   a. The EC2 instance defined in the Terraform script does have a tag.\n",
      "   b. The tag is a key-value pair with the key \"Name\" and the value \"JacksBlogExample\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Detailed explanation:\n",
      "   - The policy requires that all EC2 instances should have tags.\n",
      "   - In Terraform, tags are typically added to resources using the \"tags\" argument, which is exactly what we see in this script.\n",
      "   - The script defines one EC2 instance, and this instance has a tag applied to it.\n",
      "   - The tag may be used for various purposes such as resource organization, cost allocation, or automation.\n",
      "   - While the policy doesn't specify what tags are required or how many, the presence of at least one tag satisfies the policy requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Additional considerations:\n",
      "   - If there were multiple EC2 instances defined in this Terraform script, we would need to check that each of them had tags to fully comply with the policy.\n",
      "   - The policy as stated is quite broad. In a real-world scenario, there might be more specific requirements about which tags should be present or what values they should have.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the Terraform script satisfies the policy requirement by including a tag for the EC2 instance it defines.\n",
